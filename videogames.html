        <h1>on video games</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
        video games are definitely one of the top artforms of all time, at least in my opinion. when do you really get to immerse yourself in something so much that you ARE that character?<br><br>
        anyway, video games definitely something i hold near and dear to my heart. great stories have been told through them, 
        friends have been made through them, and they make me cry sometimes, so there's that.<br><br>

        to the right is my beautiful computer, as of july 11th at least, it will probably change throughout time. <br><br>

        my first computer i built in like, 2016. it was pretty bad and got outdated within a couple years, but it tought me how to build a pc. before my computer i had this 
        small dell laptop i got after graduating elementary school, that thing was my whole life, i played so much minecraft on that thing. although the first computer i ever used 
        was the family computer when i was little, how little? i dont know. but i do remember using it and playing like coolmathgames all the time. goodstuff
