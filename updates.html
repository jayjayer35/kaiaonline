    <strong>Monday - 7/21/25 - 6:23 PM</strong> — feeling better! more site work<br><br>

    The index page will now be replaced by the main site-log look. I plan on adding access back to the other page, 
    I'll call it 'comfort view' or something, since it is easier to view the site there. Ill figure out how to make it work out. I did some work on the friend pages, they're so much fun to work on! 
    I love seeing my friends get excited to be included on my site, super cool. <br><br>

    The main view, a.k.a log mode, now has a nice startup animation, and I included the random splash messages from my welcome page to show one of them in the startup animation which was 
    a fun challenge. I ironed out some bugs and issues on the log view as well, also a reminder: have fun looking for those <em style="color: coral;">easter egg pages!</em>, keywords gotta 
    get entered through the console, so youll see them. The easter egg pages, <em>wont</em> be included on the comfort view, so you'll only be able to access them on this page.
    <br><br>
    Now for me!<br><br>

    Supercon was great, lots of cool art, nice panels and events, enjoyed walking around and seeing the cosplays! I got kinda inspired as well, im gonna cosplay as Gabbro (from outer wilds) 
    next year, i think itll be fun to make the cosplay! <a href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.wikia.nocookie.net%2Fouterwilds_gamepedia%2Fimages%2Fc%2Fcc%2FGabbro.jpg%2Frevision%2Flatest%3Fcb%3D20190716001011&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=d7e7da72aa457192187423cc0d3b8d6d4a5ea3e703ac22ffd620cfbc37278fa3" target="_blank">here</a> 
    is a photo of what they look like. Ill work on the helmet first, then the rest of the costume with my mom's help, she knows how to sew much better than I, 
    so im relying on her! Ill document my work as I go, will be pretty cool. 
    <br><br>
    Also, from my sickness like a week ago, i think i got BOTH my parents sick, wonderul. 
    <br><br>
    Some mention of old news as well, my Puerto Rico trip is coming soon! My friend matija gave me the idea to try and sketch some of the new birds I see while on the island, im a bit of a bird 
    nerd, and ive been working on my art skills as of recent, so ill def give it a shot! Props to him for motivating me to draw more, ill have to help him with reading music now 
    its only fair haha.<br><br>

    That about wraps it up for this log! Keep exploring, and stay safe out there!

  <div class="entry">
    <strong>Thursday - 7/17/25 - 4:44 AM</strong> — hello, more site work has been done, emotions are on the floor, but we push through<br><br>

      big updates incoming, the 'rumor mode' has undergone even more work <em>(more than last!)</em>, friend entries are starting to get added, but it will be a slow process because 
      im working with them to make sure i dont overreach and can make it look how they want (with as much that my skill will let me). the page for my bird has also finally been added, if you 
      wanted to check it out. he's so cute. certain keywords in the console will make new hidden entries pop up, so fun! i think it encourages reading around, if people want to find 
      them that is.<br><br>

      moving on from that, future plans for the site are still underway, i wanna make the 'rumor mode' mobile friendly, but i dont know how difficult that would be, and i hope it 
      doesn’t require a complete and total rework of my code. i hope this isn't foreshadowing. i also wanna really tidy up what is currently the main site view. a couple entries 
      need to be added and polished out i think? i wanna change the entry splash page as well.. maybe.<br><br>

      now for the diary(?) part!<br><br>

      every summer before this one and including this one, ive just felt worse and worse. i can't really put a finger on it either. i just lose a lot motivation, begin to eat less, 
      and sleep so much more. it's only really like this during the summer, during spring im happy, and fall too. idunno. im not gonna sit here and loathe, but it does feel somewhat 
      better to document whatevers going on in my life, i enjoy looking back on it! this site has def been a good distraction from all the, or lack thereof, emotion. <br><br>

      my friend brandon has been wanting to learn to use ableton and im super excited to teach him what i know, so i gotta do that, sometime next week prob. supercon is in less than 
      a week as well, this weekend! on top of that my old friend from band class in middle school is visiting miami, so ill be hanging out with them, and my friend from band who 
      still does live in miami, dario and juan, looking forward to it!<br><br>

      as always, stay safe out there.

    <strong>Monday - 7/14/25 - 2:43 AM</strong> — all day in vscode omigosh<br><br>

    so i just pushed an update that has the first iteration of the alternate site view a.k.a "rumor mode", 
    which looks like the rumor mode on the ship log in outer wilds, can you tell im a nerd yet? It lets you view all the pages 
    in a cool environment, each page is an entry and it opens a fake window that you can move around and drag, the music player 
    is also there, but its gotta be open to play music, but its more featured than the normal one. <br><br>

    "rumor mode" will be taking my time up for a while, but it will spark new pages that i will be featuring on my "main" page, idk what 
    im gonna do or how im gonna organize it, but it'll happen whenever it happens. as is the nature of indie web development.<br><br>

    i added a handful of new buttons to the internet pt.2 page as well, wanted to do some web surfing cuz i got bored coding all day (go figure), 
    so i found some cool sites, new assets, and things of that nature. ive got lots of work ahead, but its work im looking 
    forward too! just have to be careful as to not burn myself out.<br><br>

    now about meee, im no longer sick! which actually does mean more site work. and my classes are almost complete for the summer, 
    gotta register for the fall term already jeeeez. im going to a convention this week! supercon, at the miami convention center, not going 
    as anything, but i might go one day in my big cloak for funsies. other than that, nothing is going on with me! just glad to be 
    feeling better, and happy to live life! <br><br>

    that about wraps it up for me now, im quite sleepy. stay safe out there!

    <strong>Sunday - 7/13/25 - 12:41 AM</strong> — SO MANY THING ARE HAPPENING<br><br>

    i broke the site like 10 different times cause im experimenting with an alternative site view that 
    has been taking me a while. <em>(its inspired by outer wilds)</em>. so that will be ready when its ready, lots of work 
    going in to it. joined some webrings and added them to their own little tab on the sidebar!!, we also got a hit counter 
    for unique visitors.<br><br>

    workin on the site, ill provide a much bigger update soon explaining everything ive done

  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <strong>Thursday - 7/10/25 - 5:48 PM</strong> — hi- hope you're well<br><br>

    losta updates, im forgetting everything i added, im still in the phase of migrating things from the old site... which you can view now!! at the bottom
    of the sidebar theres a little computer, clicking that will open a small resizable window that you can use to navigate and check out the old site. you can move 
    it around and stuff, its pretty cool.<br><br>

    i finished the outer wilds tribute page, cause i finished the game. and words cant describe how sappy it made me. ill just leave it at that. you need to play it 
    if you ever get the chance. i also added more songs to the music player, all from the game [outer wilds] becuase im a huge nerd. some other updates i did include 
    making a fire to toggle a campfire sound effect, auto minimizing the sidebar whenever you click on a page, which i might remove, and then i also split the internet page 
    for better organization i guess? theres a new click sound that plays whenever you click! plans to add a custom cursor too, idunno tho. also did some CSS stuff on the sidebar, and sprinkled throughout the site to make it flow a litte better.<br><br>

    now for the part about me!! im still sick, but ive been getting better- will be good by this weekend. like i said, i finally beat Outer Wilds, i still have the DLC to play 
    but the main game has been finished, and it resonated deep with me.<br>some other stuff... i got my music lessons in an hour or something, looking forward to that, although
    i havent practiced so i might get chewed out. i have plans to work on the site more afterward, if i dont get distracted with my friends on discord. i dont have anything to 
    do on fridays!!! <br><br>

    anywhooooo, stay safe out there!

  <div class="entry">
    <strong>Wednesday - 7/9/25 - 1:06 AM</strong> — hey, hows it going? hope its going well. :)<br><br>

    made a handful of changes to the site, got the 'internet' page back online, woo! i also embedded a pacman game, i had it embedded on my old site 
    as a hidden easter egg, but i would always play it when i was bored so i went ahead and added it back, but it has its own entry on the sidebar. 
    to absolutely nobodys suprise, the webchat page still isnt working, i might remove it, its been a headache to setup. but the guestbook on the 
    other hand... its been brough back from the dead! entries and all. <br><br>

    i gave this updates page a nice flashy link, considering its one of the more important pages on this site, almost like an update log, and diary... 
    kinda(?). anyway, if youre a new visitor or an old one, please be sure to sign the guestbook! i love reading through them, they bring me so much joy.
    on the topic of updates, i added the splash screen, that "starts" the site when you click on the campfire. pretty cozy, and it makes me happy, it also
     queues music when you start it :)<br>
    i started development on the photos page, and the music page is just a copy of the template page lulz.<br><br>
    
    theres a bunch of splash texts that can show up on the welcome page now! the welcome page is relatively empty right now, but thats cause i will be 
    putting links to webrings i am part of, will be looking into those as i finish up the site (to my standard). while its old news, i was just 
    reminded that the yesterweb ring was shut down, i really like that one, and thats the one that drew people in last time. we will join some new ones though :)<br><br>

    finally the part where i get to talk about myself! uhhh.. im still sick, and it hurts to speak, but i dont have class tomorrow! (technically today), 
    so i will sleep in, and if im feeling any better ill practice my clarinet, and work on this site some more. i havent had the urge to really play video
     games recently, just been so caught up in site maintenance that the urge just isnt there! .... maybe i should post a minecraft server link here because 
     i do host one....<br><br>

    anyway im going to head off to bed now, ive been sitting in discord calls all day, when im not in class, just working on the site and listening to 
    people talk, and also i showed my site to two of my friends! brandon and keegan <em>a.k.a</em> twig (we call him twig because idk we just do, so if 
    you see me mention twig, thats who im talkin about). anyway the site works as intended on other [pc] systems, so thats a relief. i was making half 
    the site without having comic sans installed on my machine cause i forgot to download it (linux!!!), but i downloaded all the windows fonts so i can 
    now work on my site efficiently(?) i guess lol.<br><br>

    okay im actually going to head to sleep now, its late and im unwell, working on this has drained me! <br><br>
    
    stay safe out there!

  <div class="entry">
    <strong>Tuesday - 7/8/25 - 2:53 AM</strong> — hihihi, been pretty sick the past couple days but thats given me time to work on the site<br><br>
    felt comfortable enough to launch the V2 site, and changed link to <a href="https://kaia.starscene.com/" target="_blank">kaia.starscene.com</a> so things are all kinda good now. i ironed out the 
    sidebar issues which was my main concern and other than that the site is pretty done. the music player doesnt auto play music because browsers like to prevent that, for the better.<br><br>
    onto me, like i said ive been pretty sick, and i technically have class in 9 hours so i should get to sleep. making this site has been a lot of work, but work well spent, i just
    wanna play minecraft! progress on the next compilation video in the videos tab, its roughly 30-40% done. okay im really hungry and lightheaded so im gonna sign off for now. it feels good to work on 
    this site again, really does. i have a place i can dump my passions and obsessions into, so definitely keep an eye out for new tabs, and changes to old ones!<br><br> as always stay safe out there
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
    <strong>Monday - 7/7/25 - 12:00 AM</strong> — Yes you can technically consider this a same day update. <br><br>
    This is the first push to the githup repo with the new site, i will have the old one archived ofc, but it will be inaccessible - unless you know internet magic o.O<br><br>
    The site is still technically in its old state cause the link is jayonline.starscene.com, but that will be changed soon... whenever i get around to it. Leave me alone!<br><br>
    A quick rundown on the new site overhaul, the biggest change is that it's no longer based on different html files, kinda. Theres one main page and then i use frames to kinda load the other page on the main one, so you're technically always on the "index" file, but you're viewing the other files through index, pretty cool! I LOVE FRAMES. ... 
    I have removed some old entries i forgot what i was gonna put in them, and i added new entries that i have new ideas for, and some tribute-esque pages to come as well. This is definitely going to be more personal than the last iteration of the site, and i hope i dont cross any virtual barriers you guys have set. As a courtesy ill obviously give a heads up if anything i say may be a little too much but to be honest i dont think i'll get to that point.
    BACK TO SITE UPDATES!! The music player is now added, and ill add some songs as i see fit, it will usually be ambient stuff or something thats soft on the ears, i will try to link the songs/artists to where you can support them if you enjoy their music. Please do, as i do it as well :)
    If you have seen my site before, or just scrolling through historical updates, you will have noticed that the name jacob is thrown around. I go by kaiasei (or kaia for short) online now so, I stopped using that name, would appreciate if you didn't call me jacob as well! Much much thanks.

    <strong>Sunday - 7/6/25 - 6:09 PM</strong> — im writing this status as i just moved all the old statuses here, transferring everything for archival purposes.<br><br>
    so here we are, new site look, and like years of rebuilding to what you're seeing now. cool isn't it?? <br><br>
    new statuses will be easier to read, as im writing them with this new format in mind, which means ill include breaks, hyperlinks, and maybe an image from time to time<br><br>
    enjoy the new site, as always it is still under construction but that wont stop me this time! <br><br> stay safe out

  <div class="entry">
    <strong>Saturday - 1/4/25 - 9:08 PM</strong> — first and foremost
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
 and
oopsies, site died
we back live though on
<a href="https://jayonline.starscene.com" target="_blank">jayonline.starscene.com</a>
...
now since that is out of the way
HOW. IS. IT. GOING!
its been a while hasnt it, and the site is still... well...
a mess.
long story short, i  wiped my computer like 9999999 time because i
was losing my mind and didnt like the current state of my computer
and i switched operating systems like a bunch, heres how it went:
win10 -> win7 -> win10 -> linux mint -> win10-> archlinux (EOS) -> win10 ->
archlinux (EOS) -> win10-> and FINALLY arch linux on EOS.
...
it was eventful to say the least. thankfully i held on to the site files
and when my friend, karma, started making his own site, i showed him my old
stuff and said i should host it again, so were live on github pages with a subdomain from
<a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/" target="_blank">this</a> wonderful site (FreeDNS), no longer paying for the domain bcuz
i dont wanna!
...
aside form the new year and holidays, things have been good and
i have been figuring things about myself and life and whatnot
studying music has been fun and i continue to enjoy it every day more and more
and practicing is great too, although i am not gonna be any type
of performing arts major because i hate performing in front of people !!!!
...
moving on, im still rollerblading on the beach, its a regular thing at this point
and its pretty relaxing, ill start uploading photos i take while im out there to the
photos tab and stuff because i know a lot of this site is unused
i talked about giving this a major rework but ive grown to love its little
charm and how stupid it looks, high-school me cooked so hard
ill need to do some cleaning up on the backend because my file
organization is uh.. horrendous so, we will to clean that up a lil
thats for another weekend.
...
oh! im gonna add a little part on the site for my minecraft server :3
i have a server hosted form my PC @ jay.starscene.com occasionally so you will be free to
join if you somehow stumble across my site. if theres any mods or anything,
all will be under the info in that section of the website
...
regarding the last post i made on this updates page- im healed, but not fully. i still need to beat Outer Wilds for him.
...
lastly, the internet is losing its personality bit by bit every day as more
AI SLOP is getting pumped into it, so
seek out art! support the work of those you love! support local artists, bands, writers, anything!
we need to be more human than ever nowawadays on the internet.
and as always stay safe out there!

    <strong>Saturday - 6/15/24 - 11:46 PM</strong> — hi. so i haven't really posted in a bit, but this one is important. a close friend of mine, jacob, passed away. 
    man i really really miss him, and it's hard to wrap my head around. this is the first time ive ever experienced a death in my life and i dont know how to process it.
    he gifted me this game, The Outer Wilds, and he really wanted me to play it. I tried to but just didn't becuase i got annoyed and gave up. i cant even bring myself to
    open the game and try it again, i just sob. ill do it one day, for him. i don't know when ill update the site again, as he was one of the- if not 
    THE person encouraging me to continue on this project, there will come a time that I will be back to 'normal' i guess. that time isnt now, and i dont know when it will be,
    im devastated. im going to go cry now.

  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <strong>Sunday - 3/10/24 - 11:00 PM</strong> — heyoo, so i did some maintenance on the site
as per usual
i made some buttons actually FINALLY work, so now they
actual lead to some pages
albeit those pages are heavily under construction
(when is something not on this is fjsdkfinuchf)
anyway so the photography page is linked to something
as is the friends page, the shitpost page isnt yet
i also fixed some of the mess on the front/cover page of this
site, which i have been wanting to do a makeover on for
a while now, so expect that soon
 (soon meaning in like a couple months LOL)
anywho, now that the technical stuff is out of the way, some stuff about me!
i spent the weekend on the beach, i live near but not on miami beach
but i got to hang out with all of my friends who had their spring breaks
this weekend, havent seen like any of them since like high-school lol
anyway, the next week approaches and i have school work to do
classes are stressful and annoying but it will get easier, probably
i also rollerbladed like ALMOST a half marathon this weekend in one sitting
which was pretty fun
okay that is a lot of text SORRRRYYYYY
i gotta change what i say at the end of all these little status updates,
hmmm
...
....
bah, ill figure that out later, im tired
as always on the internet
stay safe out there!
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <strong>Thursday - 3/8/24 - 6:43 PM</strong> — this site is soon going to get a MAAAAJOR overhaul i think
i have some other ideas and wanna make it look a little more
polished but still wanna keep that old-ish vibe if you get me
anyway, i found the files for some of the logs and stuff so i updated those
which ranged from like 4/22/22 - 5/27/22, so theres some more
LORE
alsooooo
the site is actually now LIVE AGAIN
under the domain jacob-online.net
also also, the page will always be under
http and not https.
while not secure, it allows me to view it on windows 95/98
and anyone else who may be doing that so it's the only reason
anyway im gonna update the site a little more and probably
put the updates in the next log
so yeah
as always on the internet
stay safe out there!
  </div>
  <div class="entry">
    <strong>Wednesday - 3/7/24 - 2:08 AM</strong> — goodnight! not as in bye, its just super-duper lateeee
anyway, it was a long time coming but its over
anyway im beginning to blow the dust off this website, its been
FOR. EVER.
thank you to Jacob, not me, my other friend jacob
he encouraged me to kick this shit back up
so yeah
and also ill be updating a lot of the pages accoringly,
i lost the music page which SUCKS but we will start a new one
ill replace the high school page with a life page instead because, i never
got around to finishing that one...
oh also i lost the original domain, so now its
"jacob-online.net"
which is alright, not IDEAL.
tl;dr this site needs some serious updating
and IT WILL HAPPENNNN
so just give it time, i need to fix all these old things that broke
its kinda funny i made this back in high school and now
i get to look back at all of it.
anyway im still in collge, transferred out of that original
place i was at, embry-riddle
and transferred back home and go to school near here
(in miami)
anyway anyway anyway
im excited to bring all this back, OH
I WAS ALSO IN A BAND

page heh
little heads up, the high school page doesnt ALWAYS work on other platforms
i kinda developed all the pages according to my screen which has kind of a weird
size (2736 x 1824), its because i use a microsoft surface
for my website developing
little weird stuff but yeah, just thought i'd mention it
because i am too lazy to fix it atm lol
yesterday i got my audio interface!
i dont know how to use it yet, but i can record my electric
guitar through it which is exciting
because now i can make full covers for songs
and/or make songs who knows

    <strong>Tuesday - 4/26/22 - 8:10 AM</strong> — fixed my practically destroyed html file lol
i found a way to center this div so now it should be in the
middle always, and on top of that i also centered the yesterweb
widget above this, now this index page is finally where i want it to be
still a clusterfuck of stuff but looks neat, to me
im not feeling to well so all i did was edit a bit of this html and
some of the html throughout like 5-6 files
i basically did like the bare mininum to consider for an update but
not feeling 100% so its fair
stay safe out there

    <strong>Saturday - 4/23/22 - 11:43 AM</strong> — hey everyone, not a "big" update per say
i migrated files to a new paid domain
now that i know what im actually doing
i didnt mind getting a domain name that i liked
so i went with jacobonline.net
hope u guys like the new change
it also came with my like
OWN CUSTOM EMAIL
thats so cool
also the old link will have a notice for like a week
about the change of domains, and then ill get rid of it
and then find a way to remove it from
yesterweb ring, anyway
peace out and

    <strong>Friday! - 4/22/22 - 8:27 AM</strong> — heyo! good morning and good friday everyone!
so i finally decided to put the update logs into a text box so the page
wouldnt be such a lonnnggg page
i also gave it a nice little border and background
to help distinguish it from the the rest of the page
look at me being such a cool webmaster
i also added an imood thing so thats pretty cool, its under my status
i also changed the page visit counter to a unique visitor counter
because i didnt feel like i deserved the number 270 on a counter lmao
thats it for this update for now, ill do some later if i have the time
i probably will, so keep an eye out for the friends page >:)
have a good friday everyone! peace
and as always on the internet
stay safe out there!

    <strong>Thursday - 4/21/22 - 10:05 AM</strong> — goodmorning!
i updated the internet page, fixed its scrollbars
and added some youtube videos as well
im learning how tables work so things can format properly on devices
other than computers lol
high school page is up and running and very unfinished because
i havent started working on it, but you can see the framework (literally hehe)
i need permission from a lot of my friends if theyre fine with me putting
photos of them on my website :3
hopefully theyll let me because i wanna have a big list of
them there
just for me really but ya
i added a new cool thing ot the links page at the bottom, and i also
updated the cool links part with a table so it looks a bit better now
and it doesnt have you infinitely scrolling down
ending this update log, i might add more if i have the time later
but i dont think i will
peace out everyone!
stay safe out thereeee!

    <strong>Tuesday - 4/19/22 - 8:41 AM</strong> — web update!
i finally figured out how to style the little update text, alongside that
i also added a much more prominent yesterweb ring embed because
i felt the small one at the bottom wasnt the best best best idea
on TOP of that i also added a new visit counter (woohoo)
internet page has gone under new development again, this time i think
it is going to be for good, the last two times i had
lost the actual html file so i had to remake it every
single time, regardless, the page is coming along
i decided to push an update out because i was bored
in class and wanted to do something
(i finished my work early)
oh oh also im working on a new video for the videos tab
i couldnt decied on a song but i couldnt so ive decided im gonna
mix a bunch of song, not like mix them all in
like make them transition into each other
kind of like a bunch of small videos in one big video(?)
we will see. anyway this is a good website update i think
i did a good amount of work on the site and im loveing it as always.
also im working on the friends page soon, some of them
 will have the status.cafe thing so they will be able
 to make little updates on their small profiles hopefully
obviously only if they wanna lol
okokokokokokokokokok
tl:dr
internet & friends page under development
and the video in progress
see you guys soon! :)
and as always on the internet
stay safe out there!

the "???" is for a random site in the ring, and the "<<<" and ">>>" are
for the previous and new website in the ring, pretty cool stuff
