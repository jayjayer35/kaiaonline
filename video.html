    <h2 class="star">i was here on this planet, look!</h2>
    <p> there is this thing I do, where throughout the year I will record clips of my experiences and life on one of my two cameras, 
        and compile them all into a song that i really enjoy/speaks to me at the given moment. this is just my way of "scrapbooking" i guess? idk. i 
        seriously do enjoy it a lot though. and my friends do as well, who doesnt like seeing themselves in a compilation video?? 
        <br>
        <br>
        below i have embedded videos, linked to the youtube videos that i have posted, you should def check them out if you have the time to spare.
        <br><br> make sure to pause/mute the site music if you watch the videos here!!

    <p> Song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVy9Lgpg1m8">First Date</a> - blink-182<br><br>This video was the first one I recorded and edited, so the audio is a little quiet, and the cuts may not be as clean, but it's one of the ones
    i hold near and dear to my heart, the year of me being a high school senior! </p><br>

    <p> Song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrlWrJdB9C0">Memory</a> - Sugarcult<br><br>Honestly, this is one of the roughest ones quality wise. I made it during lunch between some classes at college <em>(yeah)</em>,
    but I needed to get this one out, despite not really wanting to make it. The song choice was because this was the first song my band covered, because i kinda harassed them to LOLZ.</p><br>

    <p> Song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzJbz9qSsd0">Cheerleader</a> - Porter Robinson<br><br>You know, I dont know why, but I finally felt myself when editing this. This is my favorite video of them all so far. It just really speaks to me.
    It <em>is</em> a much bigger timeframe of clips, so it took me a while to get them all, but I do thing it was worth it. The song choice was literally done out on a whim. I was rollerblading around
    Miami Beach, and it hit me, I just knew this had to be the song.</p><br>
